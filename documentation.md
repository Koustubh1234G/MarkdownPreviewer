Welcome! to the documentation page.

Here I will guide you through making process of the idea **Markdown Previewer**.

Lets begin...

### Idea 
First I got to know about a software named obsidian, it was in hype from some time. These self-improvement or self-development software like Notion etc.
I have known Markdown for some time, but when using obsidian it feld something different. It felt like I became addicted to its minimalistic styling and system. I even made my first *resume* on this in Markdown and then converted into pdf.

So I was amazed just how easy and efficient this Markdown was and obsidian rendering. But I had no idea how to preview markdown text on local pc without using external tool like obsidian. The thought came to mind that I should be able to make something like this. As children programmers think of game making after playing game for sometime.

But how?

I had no idea, so like every newbie I went to GPT and asked...

### Beginning
The GPT gave code, I didnt like it when it gave code, I thought what is diffrence between taking code from it or downloading another software.

Created simple HTML page, added textbox for input field and another div for preview.

I asked it to just tell how should I handle Markdown when I write plane text in textfield of HTML.

It suggested that a library `marked.min.js` then I tried to learn to use it using its documentation. Initially I had some problem in parsing but eventually I got it right.

### Taste-less
I just made a program that can render Markdown text. But something felt off. In obsidian there is some good look and in my program it was plane. Obsidian could do math rendering but not mine. So I thought that the rendered math is not a part of Markdown so I searched and found that it is known as MathLatex or MathJax.

Tried to embed this into code and tried to parse it. But firstly I didnt know how things were working, so I tried understanding them.

Now I don't know what was I thinking ;)

Then after some hardships it just worked, so I didnt touch that part again haha.

Then I added some styling using CSS and theme and event triggers etc etc

I tried to make it look as professional as i could.

### Extra effort
I also tried to add help section for someone who is new to Markdown or MathLatex.
So I simply added basic examples.

### Future Endevours
I am planning to make it as a browser extensin so we can use it as a simple note app while surfing browser. 
Also thinking about adding a seperate section to make mindmaps using Mermaid script. That is good for flowcharts or other types of charts so I will try to use it as a mind map thing.


Thanks for reading...
