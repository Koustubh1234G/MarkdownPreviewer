# Markdown Previewer
This is an program that I tried to test my skills on. Recently many people are talking about obsidian and its markdown rendering functionlity etc etc...
So I wanted to make similar software myself, but how can I compare myself to big teams and their teamwork. So, this is just a simple program that satisfied my greed to make similar application.

Give it a try, I have tried to optimize it as much as I could, but there is no end to imagination so I must improve it in future.

## Features
- Supports Markdown
- Supports MathLatex
- Themes
- Help : To get help for how to use markdown or mathlatex

## External Modules
The external modules used are:
- marked.min.js
- mathjax.js

These modules have been put in `/js` folder.

## Themes
Originally the idea was to develop a theme that user can make or select from predefined list.
But for now I have just used **light** and **dark** themes for simplsity.

## Extras
There is so much lacking but, will eventually be covered in future updates.
I have many ideas for future updates. But if you have any suggestions please give them I will definitely try to improve.

## Making Process
Here is a simple documentation of how I thought at each level of making this software. Which came to reality.
